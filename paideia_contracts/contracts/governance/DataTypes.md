# Paideia Data Types

Some contracts deal with registers with varying types, they will have type identifiers stored in one of the registers (usually R4). This table shows which types are supported (and which version they have been included in).

| Identifier | Data Type | Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Empty | 1.0 |
| 1 | Long | 1.0 |
| 2 | Coll[Long] | 1.0 |
| 3 | Coll[Byte] | 1.0 |
| 4 | Coll[Coll[Byte]] | 1.0 |
